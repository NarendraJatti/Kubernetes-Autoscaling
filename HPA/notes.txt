Installation of metric service and explore the manifest file and certificate requirement

kubectl logs -n kube-system metrics-server-548b7d8875-ftmbx

kubectl get --raw "/apis/metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/nodes"

The errors show that the metrics server cannot retrieve metrics from nodes because the TLS certificates on the nodes lack the necessary IP Subject Alternative Names (SANs). This prevents certificate validation and secure connections.

kubectl get --raw "/apis/metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/nodes"
kubectl top nodes
kubectl top pods

kubectl edit deploy -n kube-system metrics-server

Objectives

HPA with Imperative commands
Requirements for HPA to work
What happens when resources.limit is not mentioned

kubectl autoscale deployment nginx-deployment --max=3 --cpu-percent=80

kubectl get hpa
kubectl describe hpa nginx-deployment
kubectl get hpa --watch

kubectl events hpa nginx-deployment | grep -i "ScalingReplicaSet"

kubectl events hpa nginx-deployment | grep -i "FailedGetResourceMetric"

Since the HPA was failing due to the resource field missing in the nginx-deployment, the resource field has been updated in /root/deployment.yml. Update the nginx-deployment using this manifest. Watch the changes made to the nginx-deployment by the HPA after upgrading by using the kubectl get hpa --watch command

Objectives

Expose Metrics: From your application
Deploy Prometheus: To scrape those metrics
Install Prometheus Adapter: To expose the metrics to Kubernetes

Business Logic Example for External Metrics Scaling: Scaling Based on Real-Time Order Data

Scenario: You are running an e-commerce platform that experiences varying traffic throughout the day. During promotional events or flash sales, you need to dynamically scale your backend services to handle the surge in orders and customer interactions. The scaling should be based on real-time sales data, such as the number of completed orders.
